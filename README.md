# Video Tracking to Audio

This python based software uses ultralytic's YoloV8 (You Only Look Once) state-of-the-art video recognition deep learning model to identify, count and track the number of people on a webcam. It asignes one granular synthetizer to each person and, depending on its X-Y position, the number of people, and the closeness between them, some parameters of the synthetizers - such as filter, pitch shift, panning and reverb - are modified in real-time.

This project was built for the Chilean 2023 exhibition 'Aparatos de Observaci√≥n Pluvial', founded by the Chilean Ministry of Culture, Art and Patrimony, FONDART 2022. Folio: 670933.
